# TV-source-as-an-action-in-Home-Assistant
As a continuation of the SamsungTVLegacy integration for Home Assistant, this repository provides the ability to create "actions" in Home Assistant and in conjunction with Google Assistant verbally change the TV source.

Pyscript HACS integration is required to run the python scripts. In Home Assistant create scripts to run the service ("action") created by Pyscript. In Google Home create automations to run the scene (Home Assistant script) with the verbal commands you want.

As always use at your own risk. I am not responsible for how you use this.
